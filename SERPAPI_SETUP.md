## Sample API Response

```json
{
  "news_results": [
    {
      "title": "Anglo American Reports Strong Q3 Platinum Production",
      "link": "https://example.com/news",
      "snippet": "Mining giant Anglo American reported...",

The system automatically:
1. Fetches real news every 5-30 minutes
2. Categorizes by safety/production/market/regulation
